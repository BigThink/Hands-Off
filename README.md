</p>


Hands-Off is a navigational tool that allows users to perform complex actions using their webcam. By showing a hand gesture to the webcam, users can perform macros, run scripts and programs, and much more. Hands-Off is focused on delivering a user focused experience that allows complete control over the functionality of the app. Create shortcuts to your favorite programs, pause media from across the room, or utilize hands-free control schemes for any web-browser.

## Motivation
This app was created by students at CSULB who wanted to reimagine how we interact with computers. Our goal is to increase accessibility for all users and remove undesirable contact in day-to-day computer interactions. By avoiding the keyboard and mouse as input devices, we can avoid harmful repetitive motion, remove touch from publicly used systems, and control personal media from a distance.

## Overview
Hands-off focuses on user-defined functionality. We allow users to register their own gestures with a webcam and define their own macros and actions. In the user's profile, we can map a number of actions onto the defined gestures to create a powerful library of actions. This allows users to create their own toolsets for a variety of workloads or functionalities. This flexibility allows Hands-Off to perform as many functions as the user can imagine.
